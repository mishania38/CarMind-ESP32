**CarMind** is a firmware for the supported microcontrollers that enables secure remote control of vehicle systems using MQTT. It supports engine start/stop, door locking/unlocking, engine heating, and real-time telemetry. Designed for reliability, modularity, and secure communication, it integrates FreeRTOS multitasking and watchdog protection.
